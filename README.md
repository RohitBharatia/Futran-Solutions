# Futran-Solutions
 Hello Everyone! This repo contains all the work I've done while interning at __Futran Solutions Pvt. Ltd.__
 The early files are small explorations related to topics I learned while completing a training segment at Futran. The work follows the Krish Naik udemy course named "Master the Theory, Practice, and Math behind Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP with end to end projects"
 The later files will be related to the work I've done during the internship.


 Glad to have you visit this page!
 Have a Great Day!
